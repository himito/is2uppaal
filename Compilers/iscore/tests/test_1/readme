This example represents a static score.
- To represent a structure :
  * Flexible template
  * Its maximum duration is not finite
  * Its minimum duration depends on the duration of the box in i-score
  * It is necessary to use a "control template" to stop the structure.
    - its minimum duration event is the start of the control template.
    - The end event of the control template is the "timeout" event of the flexible template
    - Each TO which is the last box to execute in a branch synchronizes its end with the start of the control.
  * In the case of the scenario:
    - The minimum duration is 0


- To control several fixed intervals:
  * Control Template
  * It is necessary to create a new event for the end of each interval and the start of the control.
  * The end event of the control is the start event of the following TO
